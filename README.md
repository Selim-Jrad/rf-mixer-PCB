**RF Mixer PCB:**

A Radio Frequency (RF 0.01MHz-4GHz) mixer printed circuit board designed in KiCad.
Using the LT5560 ic (low power, high performance active mixer)
**📋 Project Overview**

This repository contains the design files for an RF mixer PCB, including schematic and layout files compatible with KiCad. The board is designed to handle RF signal mixing applications with proper grounding, filtering, and signal integrity considerations.
